+  .gitkeep (Track Empty Directory)

*  Track Empty Directory

-  Does does not track empty directory. In order to track a directory, a file must exist
-  within it. A trick that many people use is to create a hidden file usually called
-  .gitkeep. The name of the file doesn't matter. As long as there is a file in the
-  directory .gitkeep, readme.txt etc, git will track directory.
